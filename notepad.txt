I have clickstreams data in S3 in large volume and also in partitioned into multiple parquet files. 
I need to get my required data by running 3 different queries. 
The results of these queries need to be joined with customer leads table from CRM. 
The leads table from CRM will not have more than 20000 leads. 
I need to build this data pipeline for this which post the final results on Google Ads API.

These are my options to do above data processing to get the final results. Access all options based on horizontal scaling, cost, performance , pros and cons. Suggest top 3 recommendations. 

1. S3-Select
2. Athena
3. Presto Client and presto platform
4. Fargate component with presto client
5. Fargate component with PySpark
6. AWS Batch with PySpark
7. AWS Batch with Presto client 
8. AWS EMR with Pyspark
9. AWS Glue with PySpark
10. AWS SDK
11. Databricks with pySpark
12. Fargate component which loads the data in the container and then use DuckDB
13. Fargate component which loads the data in the container and then use Polars
14. Fargate component which loads the data in the container and then use Pandas
15. Fargate component which loads the data in the container and then use Fireducks.

Provide response as detailed as possible. 










### **Comprehensive Analysis & Recommendations**  
Your use case involves **batch processing of large clickstream data (partitioned Parquet in S3)** with three queries, joining results with a small CRM table (â‰¤20k rows), and posting to Google Ads API once daily. Below is a detailed evaluation of options and **top recommendations** based on **horizontal scaling, cost, performance, pros, and cons**.

---

### **Key Requirements**  
1. **Batch Processing**: Daily runs, no real-time needs.  
2. **Scalability**: Handle large partitioned Parquet datasets.  
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Minimize costs for daily jobs.  
4. **Integration**: Post results to Google Ads API.

### **Option Analysis**  
#### **1. Athena**  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Fully serverless. Scales automatically for SQL queries.  
- **Cost**: Pay-per-query (~$5/TB scanned). Partition pruning and columnar Parquet reduce costs.  
- **Performance**:  
  - Optimized for S3 Parquet.  
  - Broadcast joins with small CRM table (use `MAP JOIN`).  
- **Integration**:  
  - Use Step Functions to chain 3 Athena queries, join with CRM, and trigger Lambda to post results.  
- **Pros**:  
  - Zero infrastructure.  
  - Fast for SQL-heavy workflows.  
- **Cons**:  
  - Manual orchestration (Step Functions/Lambda).  
  - Limited to SQL (no Python UDFs).  

#### **2. AWS Glue with PySpark**  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Serverless Spark. Scales via Glue Workers (up to 100 DPUs).  
- **Cost**: ~$0.44/DPU-hour. Budget-friendly for short daily jobs.  
- **Performance**:  
  - PySpark handles complex transformations.  
  - Broadcast join for CRM table (efficient for 20k rows).  
- **Integration**:  
  - Use `boto3` in Glue script to call Google Ads API.  
- **Pros**:  
  - Fully managed ETL with scheduling.  
  - Built-in Data Catalog for metadata.  
- **Cons**:  
  - Limited Spark tuning (e.g., executor memory).  

#### **3. AWS EMR with PySpark**  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Auto-scaling clusters (spot/on-demand instances).  
- **Cost**: ~70% savings with spot instances. EC2 + EMR fees apply.  
- **Performance**:  
  - Best for massive datasets.  
  - Fine-tune Spark for parallelism (e.g., partitions, broadcast joins).  
- **Integration**:  
  - Run PySpark job and use Python SDK (`google-ads`) in the same script.  
- **Pros**:  
  - Full control over Spark/hardware.  
  - Transient clusters reduce costs.  
- **Cons**:  
  - Requires cluster management.  

#### **4. AWS Batch with PySpark**  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Auto-scales EC2/Spot Instances via job queues.  
- **Cost**: Similar to EMR but containerized.  
- **Performance**:  
  - Requires custom Docker image with Spark.  
  - Less optimized than EMR/Glue.  
- **Integration**:  
  - Batch job runs PySpark + API calls.  
- **Pros**:  
  - Flexible containerized workflows.  
- **Cons**:  
  - Complex setup (Docker/ECS).  

#### **5. Fargate + DuckDB/Polars**  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Single-node (no scaling). Use parallel Batch jobs for partitioning.  
- **Cost**: Fargate vCPU/memory (~$0.04/vCPU-hour).  
- **Performance**:  
  - DuckDB/Polars process Parquet efficiently but require data filtering (e.g., S3 Select).  
- **Integration**:  
  - Python script in Fargate calls Google Ads API.  
- **Pros**:  
  - Lightweight for small/medium data.  
- **Cons**:  
  - Manual sharding for large data.  

#### **Eliminated Options**  
- **S3 Select**: No joins, limited to filtering.  
- **Presto/Fargate**: Athena is serverless and cheaper.  
- **Pandas/Fireducks**: Not scalable for large data.  
- **AWS SDK**: Raw SDKs lack processing power.  
- **Databricks**: Overkill unless already in use.

### **Top 3 Recommendations**  
#### **1. Athena + Step Functions + Lambda**  
**Why**:  
- **Serverless, low-cost, and minimal setup**.  
- Athena handles SQL queries/joins, Step Functions orchestrates workflows, and Lambda posts results.  
- **Ideal For**: Teams prioritizing simplicity and low maintenance.  

**Steps**:  
1. Upload CRM table to S3.  
2. Use Athena CTEs/temporary tables for 3 queries and final join.  
3. Trigger Lambda via Step Functions to process results and call Google Ads API.  

**Cost**: ~$1-5/day (assuming 200GB scanned).  

---

#### **2. AWS Glue with PySpark**  
**Why**:  
- **Fully managed, serverless, and scalable**.  
- Glue PySpark handles complex transformations and joins, with built-in job scheduling.  

**Steps**:  
1. Read clickstream data and CRM table into Spark DataFrames.  
2. Execute queries, broadcast join CRM data, and write results to S3.  
3. Use `boto3` in Glue script to post to Google Ads API.  

**Cost**: ~$5-10/day (10 DPUs x 15-minute job).  

---

#### **3. AWS EMR with PySpark (Spot Instances)**  
**Why**:  
- **Maximize performance for petabyte-scale data**.  
- Transient clusters with spot instances cut costs by 70%.  

**Steps**:  
1. Spin up EMR cluster with spot instances.  
2. Run PySpark job with broadcast joins and API integration.  
3. Terminate cluster post-job.  

**Cost**: ~$10-20/day (e.g., 4x r5.xlarge spot instances).

### **Final Recommendation**  
1. **Start with Athena** if your workflow is SQL-centric and data volume is moderate.  
2. **Choose AWS Glue** for automated PySpark pipelines with minimal overhead.  
3. **Use AWS EMR** for heavy data processing requiring Spark optimizations.  

**Google Ads API Integration**:  
- Use Lambda (Athena) or `boto3` (Glue/EMR) with retries and Secrets Manager for credentials.  

**Cost Optimization Tips**:  
- Athena: Compress Parquet, partition data, and use columnar projection.  
- Glue/EMR: Use spot instances and terminate resources immediately after jobs.
